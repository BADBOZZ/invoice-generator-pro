# Project State

## Latest Updates
- Initialized backend (Express + Prisma) service with linting, testing, and Prisma schema.
- Scaffolded frontend (Vite + React + TS) with health display and shared styling.
- Added optimized Dockerfiles for backend/frontend plus docker-compose stack spanning Postgres, API, and web UI.
- Created CI workflow (lint/test/build/coverage plus Docker validation) and deploy workflow for GHCR pushes.
- Added coverage gating + unit tests for env/logger utilities and TypeScript lint configs for both apps.
- Authored Docker Compose env overrides, deployment/migration/health-check scripts, and staged env templates for staging/production.
- Wired backend Prometheus metrics, Loki/Promtail logging, Prometheus+Grafana stack, and dashboards.
- Authored deployment, environment, and troubleshooting documentation plus README updates.

## Verification
- `backend`: `npm run lint`, `npm run test`, `npm run test:ci`, `npm run build`
- `frontend`: `npm run lint`, `npm run build`
- `scripts`: `RETRIES=1 scripts/health-check.sh https://example.com`
- `docker compose build backend frontend` → blocked (Docker CLI unavailable in agent workspace)

## Next Steps
- None pending – ready for acceptance and further feature work.
